## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating student feedback collected through Google Forms during various campus events. The objective was to:
- Clean and preprocess raw survey data  
- Perform **Sentiment Analysis** using `TextBlob`  
- Analyze **rating metrics**  
- Build an insightful **dashboard** with visualizations  
- Summarize findings and provide recommendations to organizers

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **TextBlob** for sentiment analysis  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualizations  
- **Google Colab** for notebook execution

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

- 🎯 Events with low sentiment scores correlate with poor speaker engagement  
- 🧠 Sessions with interactive Q&A received higher feedback ratings  
- 🎤 Recommend inviting more dynamic speakers based on positive sentiment trends  
- 🗓️ Shorter events (under 2 hrs) had higher engagement scores  
- 🛋️ Gender-wise split shows female students rated events slightly higher on average
